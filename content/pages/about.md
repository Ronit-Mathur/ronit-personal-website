\Welcome! I am a Junior studying computer science and psychology at the University of Puget Sound, this site serves both as a place to host my portfolio and show off some of what I've learned in the past few years.

This site is a WIP and is created using React JS with gatsby, source code is public on my Github, feel free to give it a look!
