How would you describe yourself? Most people answer this with their occupation, interests, lineage, or social groups, yet none of these truly encapsulates what makes one's self identity. To further complicate matters, many eastern religions have come to the conclusion that there is no self (Anatta in Pali, Anatman in Sanskrit), or more specifically no being has their own individual self, as everything in the universe is inherently interdependent.

Neurologically speaking, our sense of self is not concentrated in a specific area of the brain, yet we can identify clear junctions where the totality of oneself is constructed or interpreted.
